# Chapter 3: Data

## Data Types

- *scalar types*: integer types, floating point types, pointer types
- *aggregate types*: arrays, structures, unions

## Integer Types

- size of `short` <= size of `int` <= size of `long` according to C standard
- integer types can be *signed* or *unsigned* (convert w/ Two's Complement)
- `char`: always 1 byte
- `short`: >= 2 bytes
- `int`: >= 2 bytes
- `long`: >= 4 bytes
 
## Floating-point Types

- size of `float` <= size of `double` <= size of `long` according to C standard
- `float`: >= 4 bytes
- `double`: >= 8 bytes
- `long double`: >= 10 bytes
